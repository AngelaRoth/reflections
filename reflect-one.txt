How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed lines which had changed
    And let me compare them

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Makes it easy to change your mind
    Or to revisit good ideas which, for some reason,
    didn't make it into the final draft.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: Logical versions
    Con: Forgetting!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git was designed for code
    Google Docs was designed for complete, standalone documents(?)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by using them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    past versions are saved and easy to re-run,
    in complete packages

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    stuff
